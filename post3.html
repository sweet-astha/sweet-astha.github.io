                    <hr class="primary">
                    <p>“Hey Astha. This might be an odd time to disturb  you and you must be thinking( ki isse na kaise kru :P); deep in your thought. My intention behind this soliloquy is not to take you back  from your thought  but to be the reason behind your another smile of the day :*. (I hope you smiled now…?)(aaayyyeeeee kinni shoni ho aap)</p>
                    <p>Okay, mission accomplished, soliloquy’s over. I am just playing… :D :p</p>
                    <p>I  know the further context is quite prolonged and verbose and there are 80% chances that you might not read it full but please be nice enough to place yourself in the 20% and read every word of it. Now that you have smiled let me tell you the primary reason behind this soliloquy so allow me to take you on an ecstatic ride of memories with me(atleast for me:P). It’s going to be a bumpy ride, so fasten your seatbelts.</p>
                    <p>I still remember the first time I asked you “Ma’am Samsung kaisi company hai ” If It wasn’t Samsung I would not have met the sweetest girl of my life (everything happens for a reason). I know our friendship (jo bhi hai ) began in the most inadvertent and unexpected way. You were quite senti and deactivated your fb and I succeeded in making you smile.. I still remember the first time we chatted. I remember every conversation I ever had with you during these 2.5 months .I still remember all the senti stories we shared of our breakups. I still remember when u used to say “I get cranky in relationship”,”I am not entertaining ” “I am immature” “I don’t take right decisions” and I used to think Enna shona isse rab ne banaya hai(my favourite song) and still she doesn’t know her worth.I still remember my lost bag and the reason was you :P:*(was lost in another world while talking to you)   I still remember the valentine’s 17 week when u said mjhe proposals nahi aate and I was like “yrr aaj hi krdeta hn”. I still remember the goa nights when only I thought of two things Whisky and Astha. Even that whisky couldn’t separate my thought and my heart from you  Even in those tipsy situation I texted you :*.  I still remember all the bitching you did of ur ex and your girl friends (they are mean they are matlabi and chant :P) I still remember how excruciating task it was to find your email , but finally, I found you and wrote that long email thinking that u were gusha from but when u said i make u happy was enough for me :* I still remember when you said “ek din tu mjhe bhool jaayga ”plzz don’t repeat these words..</p>
                    <p>In most of our chats I made you smile, I made you laugh, I made you feel nice, and it’s always a pleasure to be the reason behind that cute smile (bht sweet ho aap :*). But sometimes I annoyed you, I irritated you and even bothered you sometimes and I truly apologise for that.</p>
                    <p>And last but not the least, thank you for enduring me for 2.5 months and congratulations to you because you are the first girl to do so…! I want to thank you for giving me these wonderful memories and these will be locked in my heart forever. And I hope that they stay forever in your heart toohead</p>
